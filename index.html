					Computers have been incorporated into every aspect of our lives. They have helped advance a wide range of fields, ranging from medical to business to entertainment. Alongside those fields, computers have advanced too. Unlike Apple and Google, Microsoft hasn’t been on the forefront of technology of computer hardware recently. Due to this shift in focus does this cause the evolution and advancement in windows computers to slow down?

										I tried to find a good starting place to begin my research and to narrow my focus on the topic. At the time I wasn’t looking for credible sources or accurate sources. All that mattered to me at the time was any bit of information that would launch me on the right path for my topic. Using google scholar I entered the topic I am research to only find a sea of articles that weren’t related to my topic at all. The articles only contained key word that where in the topic.
									</p>
									<p class="modal-para">
										That's when I decided that the nomadic roaming method wasn’t getting me anywhere, so I decided to narrow my focus through the categories I set for myself. I decided to limit my research to the processing unit category.

									<p class="modal-para">
										I tried to stay away from anything with complicated science such as quantum physics because explaining that in itself can take up alot of space. While also just leave someone, like myself, confused for the rest of the day.
										Although a thing that peaked my interest was quantum computers. Not the science behind the computers because that's just a conglomerated mess of quantum physics, but one of the benefits that this computer can provided.

										After watching this video which lead me on a path. I went on google scholar to do more research on the points that the first half of the video brought up. As I was skimming through a bunch of articles, PDFs, and websites, which I barely understood by the way, until I came across the article “A single-atom transistor”, which explained that:
									</p>
									<blockquote class="modal-quote">
										Silicon technology is now approaching a scale at which both the number and location of individual dopant atoms within a device will determine its characteristics, and the variability in device performance caused by the statistical nature of dopant placement is expected to impose a limit on scaling before the physical limits associated with lithography and quantum effects are reached.
									</blockquote>
									<p class="modal-para">
										Basically states that the transistors on computers are getting too small to follow the laws of physics that we live in, instead they started to follow quantum physics.
									</p>
									<img class="modal-img-long" src="img/quantum.jpg">
									<p class="modal-para">
										This means that the advancement of the processing component of a computer will dramatically slow until this hurdle is passed. Although when the challenge is conquered, processing power of the computer will exponentially increase.

									I changed my focus from the processing unit category to the storage unit category mainly because I wanted to leave the control unit category for last. Instead of wandering around the internet for an hour or two I decided to research hard drives and see if it has advanced at all recently. I found out that not to long ago magnetic disk drives were considered top of the line. 
								</p>
								<img class="modal-img pull-right" src="img/mdd.jpg">
								<p class="modal-para">
									Even the journal published in 2003 states “Since the first disk drive was introduced in 1956, drives have undergone a rapid evolution, thanks to the application of new magnetic, electronic, and mechanical technologies.” Since 2003 the way we have used technology has drastically increased and changed. With the increase of popularity and usage also increased the need of storing data. 
								</p>
								<img class="modal-img pull-left" src="img/ssd.jpg">
								<p class="modal-para">
									When the solid state drive was introduced the world went from storing gigabytes to storing terabytes. The article “Query Processing Techniques For Solid State Drives” states “ SSDs perform random reads more than 100x faster than traditional magnetic hard disks, while offering comparable sequential read and write bandwidth.” Basically, we have the capability to store more than a magnetic disk drive.

								<div class="container-fluid">
									<img class="pull-left modal-img" src="img/bryan.jpg">
									<p class="modal-para">
										I interviewed Bryan, a programmer at centercode and someone who has seen the advancement of computer technology, to see what his opinion on the topic was. While interview him I realized the way I was researching was going it the wrong direction. I started the interview by asking an overall question “What is you opinion on the evolution of windows computers?”
									</p>
									<img class="modal-img-long" src="img/moore.png">
									<p class="modal-para">
										He started by talking about Moore's Law and how at the time moore only meant it for the processor, but it turns out to be true about every component. Basically saying, yes, computers are evolving, but they aren’t going in one direction. At first computers were improving on the component level, then focus shifted to more mobile devices. He summarized the change in technology. Fifteen years ago laptops were bricks, Ten years ago you had to have an external device to get wifi, Five years wifi came built in.
									</p>
									<img class="pull-right modal-img" src="img/power.jpg">
									<p class="modal-para">
										Another question that had an interesting response was “How has power supplies change?” His answer was that it is something that is in dire need to have an upgrade since it hasn’t changed in twenty years. The change in power consumption isn’t the source itself, but the power consumption of the components.
									</p>
									<p class="modal-para">
										After I finished the interview with bryan I went to confirm what he said during the interview. I started by researching the concept behind moore’s law. The article, “Moore’s Law: past, present, and future” confirms his statement about moore’s law by stating that, “one in which density doubled every 18 months, but which still behaved in a log-linear fashion, The projections were still breathtaking. Shortly after this, his plot was dubbed Moore's Law.”

								<article>
									<p>I found it interesting that if you were to research about apple computers instead of windows computers your results would be very similar. This is because both computers use the same hardware the only thing that differs is the way that the software interacts with the hardware. In the article “Hardware/ Software Co-Design” explains that: </p>
									<blockquote>
										In most digital systems, the hardware is programmed by some software programs to perform the desired functions… Hence the abstraction level used for programming models is the means of interaction between hardware and software. There are two important issues related to programming: 1) who has access to programming the system and 2) the technological levels at which programming is performed.
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										Basically this article is saying that the hardware of a device, a computer in our case, is programmed to carry out its purpose of being created and that program must interact with the components of said device. This is the same with both apple and windows. The difference comes from the issues stated in the the article above. Apple computers are more willing to allow the users to program the computer than windows computers.

								<article>
									<p>
										Even though computers haven’t slowed down, the evolution of certain component have. There are certain components that have hit a scientific barrier and others that just has never been improved upon in the last twenty years. There is only going to be more advancement in computer world that the windows computers will only benefit from. Windows computers have actually evolved in recent year, but not in the usual way. The speed of a computer hasn’t improved, but the efficiency has improved. Now the computer components draw less power from the power supply and speed doesn’t come from the components, but the way the computer is design. The components are the computer’s organs and blood. Even if the is the thing that the user interacts with, the software can not surpass the hardware of the computer.
